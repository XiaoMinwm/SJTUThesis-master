Control systems used in the power grid, industrial automation, and transportation are fundamental parts of modern society. Due to their strategic importance and large attack surfaces, they are becoming attractive targets for attacks leading to physical damage [16], [29]. Most recently, it was revealed that the Stuxnet malware uploaded malicious code to Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) to physically damage the centrifuges they controlled [11]. A recent study found that PLC honeypots experienced not only port scanning, but also attempts at modifying control system specific protocols and access to system diagnostics [34]. These vulnerable Internetconnected controllers are exposed by computer search engines such as Shodan [1]. This has led to efforts for securing critical infrastructure based on control systems [17], [31]. Recent research has demonstrated that attacks against PLCs can be partially automated [18]. This makes the protection of PLCs from malicious code injection of paramount importance
